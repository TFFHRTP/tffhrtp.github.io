We are The Foundation for Human Rights through Photography, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that uses photojournalism and education to inspire action on human rights.

Humans deserve certain rights in life; we support photojournalists that want to help promote human rights. Regardless of if it is positive or negative, if it is human rights, it needs to be documented. The human mind forgets; but in the digital age-the computers almost guarantee that it wonâ€™t be forgotten. Humans learn from their mistakes and wins, so that they may educate themselves on what they have done right or wrong. Because of this, we encourage photojournalists around the world to use their artistic skills to document human rights, in context, so that we may learn from what we as humans have done right, and wrong, and change our future actions accordingly.
