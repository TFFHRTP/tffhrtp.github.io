Your Support Fuels the Fight for Human Rights
{{% /blocks/lead %}}
{{% blocks/section %}}

Millions of people around the world are facing human rights violations, such as war, genocide, torture, slavery, and discrimination. These atrocities often go unnoticed or ignored by the mainstream media and the public. Thatâ€™s why we use photojournalism to educate others on how they can help promote human rights. Our photojournalists risk their lives to document the human rights abuses and the human dignity in the most challenging and dangerous situations.

Every image captured, every story told, is a step toward a more just and compassionate world. We urgently need your help to continue our vital work. Your generous donation empowers us to:

Send photojournalists to the front lines: $100 sponsors a day in the field, $500 covers travel to a conflict zone.
Amplify silenced voices: $1,000 produces a powerful publication on a critical human rights issue.
