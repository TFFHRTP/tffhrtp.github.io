**Mission Statement**

__1. Photojournalism as a road to Change__

In the digital era, photos can be stored forver. Photojournalism has the power to bring this to life, and is ubiquitous. From iconic images that have shaped our collective memory to everyday snapshots that encapsulate personal memories, photography holds a unique ability to convey emotions, evoke empathy, and spur action.

Combining photjournalism with digital technology allows us to effectively store images that capture stories of human rights forever. We aim to use this technology to learn from our past and direct us on how we should improve in the future, so that we can direct humanity in a better way.

The Power of Perspective: Photojournalism allows us to step into the shoes of communities throughout the world and see through their eyes. It breaks down the imaginary walls that separate us and fosters a sense of empathy and understanding. We are reminded of our shared humanity as we examine photographs that capture marginalized individuals’ everyday struggles, dreams, and triumphs.

Moving Hearts and Minds: A powerful photograph has the potential to awaken dormant emotions, stirring our hearts and igniting a sense of responsibility. It can inspire individuals to stand in solidarity with marginalized communities, dismantle systemic inequalities, and champion social justice.

Challenging Stereotypes: Photojournalism disrupts prevailing stereotypes and brings nuance to complex narratives. By showcasing the multifaceted nature of marginalized communities, it challenges preconceived notions and encourages a more inclusive and informed perspective.

__2. Fighting for Diversity__

At The Foundation for Human Rights through Photography, we firmly believe everyone deserves to be heard. Through our photography initiatives, we strive to amplify the voices of marginalized communities, providing a platform for their stories to be seen, heard and understood.

Through collaboration with local communities, NGOs, and photographers, we work to identify and address the critical issues marginalized communities face. Our projects are powerful tools to raise awareness, provoke dialogue, and foster positive change. By providing a visual narrative that transcends language barriers, we aim to empower marginalized voices and catalyze action.

__3. Inspiring Action through Photojournalism__

Photojournalism has the remarkable ability to inspire action that transcends the digital realm. It can mobilize communities, spark conversations, and galvanize individuals into tangible change-makers. Our photography projects aim to bridge the gap between awareness and action.

We believe in the motto, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” A single photograph can evoke emotions, illuminate injustice, and motivate individuals to get involved in highlighting the needs of marginalized communities. It can serve as a catalyst for public discourse, policy changes, and even grassroots movements.

__4. Get Involved: Stand up for Equality__
