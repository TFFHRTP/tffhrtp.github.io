The Foundation for Human Rights through Photography was established in 2023. Our goal is to educate, document, and capture human rights through the lens of photography. We strive to use photography as a way to show that all humans have a right for the greater good. They should have equal rights given to them, no matter where they are located. We are currently focused on documenting human rights, and need your help expanding throughout the globe.
